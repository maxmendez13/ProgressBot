A discord bot that helps track progress of projects. I created this for a Hackathon in the fall of 2023. I never submitted to the competition but this is the code for it.

I used https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/ article to help me write the code for this project.
I worked on the project by myself.
The Hackathon was HackRU Fall 2023 at Rutgers University New Brunswick
